The *League Dancing* competition gives you the freedom to explore robotics in a creative and expressive way. In this competition, the goal is to build a robot that, either alone or with your team, delivers an amazing performance with visuals and music. Participants are judged not only on their robotics skills but also on decoration, storytelling, and overall enjoyment.  

This was my first robotics competitions. It gave me the opportunity to put my initial programming skills to the test by programming Lego Mindstorms NXT.

In the regional competition we got 3rd place, allowing us a spot in the National competition.
