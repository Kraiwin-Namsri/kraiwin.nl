The Technasium is a specialized educational track in Dutch secondary schools that focuses on science, technology, and engineering. It is designed for students in the pre-university (VWO) and higher general secondary education (HAVO) streams who have an interest in technical and scientific subjects.
A key component of the Technasium is the subject Onderzoek & Ontwerpen (Research & Design), where students work in teams on real-world projects commissioned by companies, government institutions, or research organizations. These projects challenge students to develop innovative solutions, conduct research, and apply engineering principles in practice.
The program emphasizes collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving skills, preparing students for further studies and careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.
