In the *Rescue* competition, a robot must independently navigate a course without any human intervention.  

During this competition, my programming skills improved significantly compared to the previous year. This time, we successfully integrated simple color sensors into our programs to complete the course.

In the regional competition we got 2nd place, allowing us a spot in the National competition.
