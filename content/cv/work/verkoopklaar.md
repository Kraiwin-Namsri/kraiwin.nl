This was my first work experience. My role was to make the store sales-ready, which included stocking shelves, cleaning, organizing, assisting customers, and performing the basic tasks associated with a first job. I left this position because there was no room for growth. I wanted something where I could apply my knowledge, competencies, and skills.
