As an IT support technician at my high school, I was responsible for managing and updating laptops in bulk, providing repair services for both teachers' and students' laptops, and assisting with password resets. Additionally, I handled the repair and maintenance of 3D printers, offered computer support during breaks, and managed the bookkeeping for loaned laptops.
