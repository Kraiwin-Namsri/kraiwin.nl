O=O ("Opgeschreven is Ontwikkeld") is a company contracted by several occupational pension funds to act as their administrative office, handling communication and regulatory tasks. In this role, I work on fund documents, including design, content, and other related aspects. I also conduct checks based on annual changes to ensure there are no discrepancies. I develop tools to automate some of the repetitive tasks, improving efficiency in the process.
