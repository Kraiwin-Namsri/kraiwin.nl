My team, consisting of five senior students and seven junior students, worked on a solar boat to compete in the Elfstedentocht. This race was organized by the foundation The Ultimate Solar Boat Challenge. The goal of these races was to complete the course as quickly as possible. In 2022, we placed 4th out of 27 teams.

Within the team, I was responsible for telemetry and the electrical system. I designed and programmed a circuit board for the solar boat that enabled real-time data monitoring from the shore. Based on this data, I collaborated with another team member to determine our race strategy.

In 2023, we focused on redesigning the telemetry system, and that year we placed 8th. Over the past year, I primarily dedicated myself to transferring my knowledge to younger students. With this, I hoped to establish the ITT team as the best-performing team in the long run.
